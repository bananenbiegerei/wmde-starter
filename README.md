# BB WMDE Theme

## Installation & Setup

### Node Modules

The first thing to do after cloning the repo is to install node modules for the project: `npm install`.

### ACF Blocks Submodule

Our ACF blocks are now have their own repository: [wmde-blocks](https://bitbucket.org/bbteam2016/wmde-blocks/). They can be added to any theme as a submodule.

The `wmde-blocks` submodule is installed by running `git submodule update --init` from the project directory.

### BrowserSync

To setup BrowserSync copy the file `.env-example` to `.env` and edit accordingly:

- `BROWSERSYNC_PROXY_URL`: base URL of your local WP instance (e.g. `wkmde.local`, no `http://`!)
- `BROWSERSYNC_OPEN_BROWSER`: start browser when running gulp

## Formatting Standards

Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io) with your IDE to get automatic formatting of the code. Ideally you'll setup your IDE so that files are formatted upon saving.

The Prettier config is defined in `package.json` under the `prettier` key and should be automatically used.

- "printWidth": 200 (80 is way to short for modern screens...)
- "useTabs": true (use tabs instead of spaces)
- "phpVersion": "8.0" (among others will convert `array()` to `[]`...)
- "singleQuote" and "jsxSingleQuote": true (use single quotes by default)

## ACF Blocks

### Managing Changes

The `blocks` directory contains the ACF blocks from the `wmde-blocks` submodule. It behaves as its own git project.

If you make changes to blocks you can sync them to the repo:

```
cd blocks
git commit -a -m 'Your commit message'
git push
```

To update the submodule from the repo to the latest remote version, run the following:

```
cd blocks
git pull
```

### ACF-JSON

The ACF-JSON files for the blocks are _not located_ in the `acf-json` directory. They are loaded from the corresponding directories in `blocks`. This means the fields cannot directly be imported and edited in the backend.

If you wish to do that use symlinks. For example for the Card block you would do this (from the project top directory):

```
ln -s blocks/card/group_63da65f585957.json acf-json/

```

This will create a symbolic link and make the fields importable in the backend. All changes to the symlink will be mirrored to `blocks/card/group_63da65f585957.json`.

Once you're done with the changes, delete the group in the backend. It will be removed from the DB, the symlink will be deleted. The file `blocks/card/group_63da65f585957.json` will still be there and the block will remain active.

NOTE: _Make sure to NOT commit the symlinks to the repo!_

## String Translations

The theme will set the constant `BB_TEXT_DOMAIN` to the value setup in `style.css`. When using localization functions, make sure to use `BB_TEXT_DOMAIN` as the text domain. For example:

`<?php _e('my example text', BB_TEXT_DOMAIN); ?>`

## Features

When logged in the current page can be edited by pressing `CTLR-E`.

## Colors

The colors used in the theme must be declared in (at least) two locations: the Tailwind configuration and a script to load the colors values into the ACF fields.

### Tailwind Config

In `tailwind.config.js`:

```
module.exports = {
	safelist: [
		{
			pattern: /(text|bg)-(black|white|primary|gray|gray-700|primary-50|primary-600|red|red-50|green-50|green-700|neon|neon-800)/,
		},
	],
}
```

### ACF Fields:

In `acf-blocks.php`:

```
add_filter('acf/load_field/name=color_light', function ($field) {
	$field['choices'] = [
		'default' => 'Default',
		'white' => 'White',
		'gray' => 'Gray',
		'red-50' => 'Red',
		'green-50' => 'Green',
		'primary-50' => 'Blue',
		'neon' => 'Neon',
	];
	return $field;
});

add_filter('acf/load_field/name=color_dark', function ($field) {
	$field['choices'] = [
		'default' => 'Default',
		'black' => 'Black',
		'gray-700' => 'Gray',
		'red' => 'Red',
		'green-700' => 'Green',
		'primary' => 'Blue',
		'neon-800' => 'Neon',
	];
	return $field;
});
```

## Development and Build

For development run `npm run dev`.

For building (for production site) run `npm run build`.

For creating an archive to install the theme run `npm run package`. A zip will be created in `dist` with a timestamped theme version. Note that this will also delete all symbolic links in the `acf-json` directory.
Upload zip file to bb server. You wll find a directory called updates/themes. Upload and rename the zip file on server to only "wmde".
Go to wordpress instance -> themes. Mark the theme and check for updates. Then update.

_Do not manually upload files to the live server. Install the theme in the backend with the zipfile (unless it's for an emergency fix)._
